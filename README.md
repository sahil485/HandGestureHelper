# SelfTrainedGestures

Repository made as a self-challenge based on a Slingshot Open Source Sunday (OSS) challenge in which a self-trained model is used to make classifications of hand gestures which are assigned respective tech controls.

Currently supports following functionalities with high accuracy:

1) Thumb up - scroll up
